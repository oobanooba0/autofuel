Version: 1.2.0
Date: 2025-12-28
  Changes:
    - Autofuel now only refuels one player equipment grid item per tick, instaid of trying all of them. (this may cause a little jank when using 2 different equipment grid power sources that use 2 different fuel categories, but like, come on. big performance gains)
    - Some misc script improvements that should, hopefully, lead to better performance.
  Bugfixes:
    - having blueprint books in your inventory (like some kind of monster) no longer causes insane lag.
